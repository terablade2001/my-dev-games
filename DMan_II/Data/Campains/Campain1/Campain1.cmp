1075      Welcome.. As you know an Angel, who invited by the heavens to protect man kind from the blindness of greed, was fail to his mission. After an innerside battle of him and his greed's darkness he was defeat and as wisemen says imprisoned in a world full of greed. King's magesty of humans empire is looking for the best mercenaries to search, find and destroy the fallen Angel, before the darkness of greed slays more souls, as it is unknown if another angel will be send to restore what we've lost. You were offered to be such a mercenerary and I'm going to be your guide in your search.~     You will travel north to an area I've marked interesting. Snakes was gathered around a mountain into a forest, that only few we know, probably meaning there is a kind of evil power there. "I suggest follow the third our of the day, and when it come to an end, follow the twelve..."~     For this starter mission I will provide you with 20 Firestrikes. Use them wisely... (FireStrikes: Flames that cause small damage to anything step in them.. Use: Press 'B')~~     Good Luck...

267       Yes.. As you saw something is going on there.. The forgotten mines of the Azreth mountains for some reason are inhabitable again. That means, as I was suspect, there might be what we are looking for, to vanish.~     Very well.. So.. Ready for the next mission?

767      Having talk with King's counsellors, they denied to send men to explore the region you searched. One group of mercenaries found a pack of monsters at South, which attacked and killed at least half of them. The one returned said the monster wasn't care about them, or their allies bodies, but just for the weapons and diamonds they had. That means greed's center of darkness probably is there.~     King prepared an army to move that location. Having no time you should continue your search for the Angel, deeper in the mountains of Azreth. Despite my asking for more ammunition for you, King's counsellors just agreed to spare 50 diamonds and 20 more Firestrikes for you.~     I'm letting you to your quest, as I am going to talk again with them... Take care...

164      Hmm.. There seems you found an entrance to a forest we didn't know. I would be pleased if you could search longer in that places just to recognise the area...

491      Unfortunately there was another one unexpected attack at South, where monsters vanish four villages. King is sending right away the army he has prepared there. All men left behind must be prepared for war. Althought your help would be appreciate for what is coming, I succeed to persuade the councelers to let you continue your quest. I'm sorry for telling you this, but they refused to aid you with diamonds or weapons.~     You are on your own, at least for now...~~     Take care...

578      We decided to send you deeper in thieves guild. We believe they have many diamonds there enought for us to supply our army and our mercenaries. We would like to aid you with worthing men, but they already has left with kings army for South. You are the only one that could bring us back the stolen diamonds. I would like to tell you not to engage every thief or enemy you see. There might be too many for just one man...~      Because you are going to need maximun firepower you get from us... 300 diamonds, 50 firestrikes, 40 liquid bombs, and 20 mines.. Use them well...

335      You found Lordier! Now the mystery found an answer. He trapped thieves treasury, without letting them use the large amounts of diamonds they had store in there. They couldn't find him in their own guild, so they decided to eliminate his family. He thought he was smart, but in that way he condemn himself and his loved persons...

443     Thank you for returned us the diamonds back. King is very pleased with you! But we have not time to loose, as many men of the army loose their courage and attracted from the dark side of greedness. So some councelors too. They asked not only to return all the diamonds, but also any equipment you found. Althought I tried to persuade them not to take all from you, I couldn't achieve anything.~     Please hurry for the good of us all...
